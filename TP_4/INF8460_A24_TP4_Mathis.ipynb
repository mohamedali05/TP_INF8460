    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Description du TP4\n",
    "\n",
    "Dans ce TP, vous allez travailler sur un système de **génération augmentée de récupération**, ou **RAG** (pour Retrieval Augmented Generation en anglais) qui combine des modèles de langue génératifs et de recherche d'information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Étant donnée une question, il faudra retrouver les passages les plus pertinents  avec un modèle de recherche. Ensuite, il faudra générer une réponse à la question en utilisant ces passages de texte. Vous aurez finalement à trouver des manières d'améliorer les performances de votre modèle RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "L'ensemble est noté sur 100 points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description des données\n",
    "\n",
    "Les passages donnés sont des textes en anglais de quelques phrases sur divers sujets. Par exemple, les mathématiques, la physique, la chimie, la biologie l'informatique, la musique et la psychologie. En général, les textes abordent des sujets très spécifiques reliés à un domaine. Par exemple, il pourrait y avoir 1000 textes parlant d'informatique et 100 qui abordent, à leur manière, la notion de mémoire. Parmi ces 100 passages, 5 pourraient aborder la mémoire dans un processeur spécifique.\n",
    "\n",
    "En ce qui concerne les questions, elles sont basées sur les sujets de certains textes précis et on peut y répondre à l'aide d'au moins un des textes. Dans certains cas, plusieurs textes sont nécessaires pour répondre à la question. Par exemple, plusieurs textes pourraient aborder le processeur Intel i7-13700k, mais la question pourrait nécessiter l'information de tous ces textes pour trouver la réponse. \n",
    "Les questions ont été créées pour faire en sorte que les réponses soient assez courtes. Il peut s'agir d'un simple nombre ou de quelques mots (< 30 mots).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Vous trouverez ~ 13 000 passages dans le corpus pour ~ 1 700 paires de questions / réponses dans le jeu d'entraînement et ~ 500 dans le jeu de validation. Vous devez prédire 500 réponses aux questions du jeu de test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exemple\n",
    "\n",
    "Par exemple, pour la question\n",
    "\n",
    "> What type of bonds are used to form branches in glycogen?\n",
    "\n",
    "Avec l'approche RAG, plutôt que de générer la réponse directement, on va d'abord chercher dans un corpus de passages. Dans cet exemple, un des passages pertinents est :\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Glycogen Structure and Function** : Glycogen is a molecular polymer of glucose used for energy storage. It is composed of linear chains of glucose molecules linked by α-1,4-glycosidic bonds, with branches formed off the chain via α-1,6-glycosidic bonds. The branches provide additional \"\"free ends\"\" for linear chains, allowing for faster glucose release.\n",
    "\n",
    "Puis on génère une réponse conditionnée par les passages pertinents :\n",
    "\n",
    "> α-1,6-glycosidic bonds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Le RAG est une approche très populaire en ce moment. Elle permet notamment d'avoir des sources qui supportent les réponses générées, ce qui peut être utile pour la vérification de faits ou pour contrôler les hallucinations. De plus, elle permet d'intégrer des connaissances externes et récentes dans les modèles de génération sans avoir à les ré-entraîner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectif du TP\n",
    "\n",
    "Dans ce TP, vous implémenterez plusieurs systèmes de question-réponse. D'abord, vous testerez une approche de prompting qui n'utilise aucun passage pour aider le modèle de génération. Puis vous implémenterez un système figé qui utilise un modèle de plongements figé pour retrouver les $k$ passages les plus pertinents. Ces passages seront ensuite donnés à un modèle de génération figé aussi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enfin, vous implémenterez votre propre méthode dans l'objectif d'atteindre les meilleures performances dans la compétition Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jeux de données\n",
    "\n",
    "Vous avez 4 fichiers à votre disposition :\n",
    "- 'rag_texts.csv' : le corpus de passages extraits de Wikipédia.\n",
    "  - **id** : l'identifiant unique du passage.\n",
    "  - **text** : le texte du passage.\n",
    "- 'rag_questions_train.csv', 'rag_questions_val.csv' et 'rag_questions_test.csv' : les questions d'entraînement, de validation et de test.\n",
    "  - **id** : l'identifiant unique de la question.\n",

Cette contrainte permet de mieux comparer les différentes approches et d'éviter que la performance soit uniquement due à un modèle de génération plus performant.\n",

      "[' Polymorphism in the CYSLTR2 gene has been associated with the inheritance of asthma in separate populations. The M201V variant of CYSLTR2 exhibits decreased responsiveness to LTD4, suggesting that this hypo-responsiveness underlies its asthma transmission-protecting effect.  Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CYSLTR2) is a receptor that binds to cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and contributes to mediating allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in humans. It is expressed in various cell types, including blood eosinophils, platelets, and tissue mast cells.  The human CYSLTR2 gene maps to chromosome 13 and consists of four exons. The protein encoded by CYSLTR2 is composed of 347 amino acids and shares only 31% amino acid identity with the CysLTR1 protein. CYSLTR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that activates the Gq alpha subunit and/or Ga subunit of its coupled G protein when bound to its CysLT ligands.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the effect of the M201V variant of CYSLTR2 on responsiveness to LTD4?', '  Carbapenems are structurally similar to penicillins, but with a carbon atom replacing the sulfur atom in position 1. They are biosynthesized through a series of steps involving the condensation of malonyl-CoA with glutamate-5-semialdehyde, followed by the formation of the β-lactam and saturated carbapenam core.   Carbapenems are a class of highly effective antibiotic agents commonly used for the treatment of severe or high-risk bacterial infections. They are usually reserved for known or suspected multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections and have a broader spectrum of activity compared to most cephalosporins and penicillins.   The growing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae has led to a renaissance of the use of antibiotics such as colistin. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are also resistant to carbapenems due to their expression of a wide range of resistance mechanisms, including beta lactamases and efflux pumps.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the key difference in the structure of carbapenems compared to penicillins?', '  The 8-demicubic honeycomb is a uniform space-filling tessellation in Euclidean 8-space, constructed as an alternation of the regular 8-cubic honeycomb.

Answer the question using as few words as possible : What binds to the NMDA receptor with higher affinity than PCP?', '  BARF is a non-coordinating anion that interacts only weakly with cations, making it useful in studying highly electrophilic cations. It is less coordinating than hexafluorophosphate and is often used in coordination chemistry.   BARF can be used in catalytic systems where the active site requires an anion that will not coordinate to the metal centre and interfere with the catalytic cycle. This is particularly useful in the preparation of polyketones.   The sodium salt is the starting point for most BARF derivatives, which can be prepared by treating Grignard reagents with NaBF4. A popular method involves the reaction of NaBF4 with ArFMgBr to form NaBArF4.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What type of anion is BARF?', \"  The electron heat capacity can be approximated as proportional to the temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level. This approximation is a reasonable heuristic for inferring when it may be necessary to include electronic entropy in the thermodynamic description of a system.   The Debye-Hückel and Thomas-Fermi approximations are two methods used to calculate the screened potential in a fluid. The Debye-Hückel approximation is valid at high temperatures, while the Thomas-Fermi approximation is valid at low temperatures.

Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the approximation for the electron heat capacity?\", \"  HLA-DP functions as a cell surface receptor for foreign or self-antigens, allowing the immune system to survey and respond to pathogens. The receptor is found on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and presents antigens to T-cells, which can then activate an immune response.   HLA-DP is a protein/peptide-antigen receptor composed of two subunits, DPα and DPβ, which are encoded by the HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 loci. The receptor is responsible for recognizing foreign or self-antigens and presenting them to T-cells, playing a crucial role in the immune system's response to pathogens.   HLA-DP can also present self-antigens to T-cells, which can lead to autoimmunity if the immune system fails to recognize these antigens as self. Regulatory T-cells can help prevent autoimmunity by suppressing the activation of T-cells that recognize self-antigens.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the primary function of HLA-DP in the immune system?\", '  Stibine is used in the semiconductor industry to dope silicon with small quantities of antimony via chemical vapour deposition (CVD).

It has also been applied to ligation of polysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid and has been shown to be preferable to other coupling agents in several cases.   DMTMM is prepared by coupling 2-chloro-4,6,-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazine (CDMT) and N-methylmorpholine (NMM). CDMT spontaneously reacts with NMM to form the quaternary ammonium chloride salt of DMTMM.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is DMTMM commonly used for in amide synthesis?', '  A Baxter permutation is a permutation that satisfies a specific generalized pattern avoidance property, which can be equivalently expressed using vincular patterns. This property ensures that certain patterns are not present in the permutation.   Baxter permutations have several interesting properties, including a formula for their enumeration, which is graded by the number of descents in the permutations. Additionally, the number of alternating and doubly alternating Baxter permutations can be expressed in terms of Catalan numbers.   Baxter permutations were introduced by Glen E. Baxter while studying the fixed points of commuting continuous functions. Specifically, he showed that the permutation induced by such functions on a subset of their fixed points is always a Baxter permutation.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the property that a permutation must satisfy to be considered a Baxter permutation?', '  NGC 300 is a spiral galaxy in the constellation Sculptor, one of the closest galaxies to the Local Group.

One common solution is to suppress nanocrystal ionization by growing a very thick semiconductor shell around the nanocrystal core. However, blinking was reduced, not eliminated, because the fundamental processes responsible for blinking were still present.   Colloidal nanocrystals exhibit a phenomenon called blinking, where they randomly turn their photoluminescence on and off even under continuous light illumination. This behavior has been observed in single colloidal nanocrystals and is also known as luminescence intermittency.

The key length of an encryption algorithm is crucial to its security, with longer key lengths providing stronger encryption; modern symmetric encryption algorithms use key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits, making 40-bit encryption obsolete.  The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) uses elliptic curve cryptography, which requires a private key of a certain size. The size of the private key is about twice the size of the security level, measured in bits. For example, at a security level of 80 bits, the size of an ECDSA private key would be 160 bits.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the recommended key size for asymmetric encryption to ensure security?', 'Dynorphins exert their effects primarily through the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), a G-protein-coupled receptor. They also have some affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor. The effects of dynorphins vary depending on the receptor they bind to, with KOR being the primary receptor. Dynorphins are a class of opioid peptides produced from the precursor protein prodynorphin. They are stored in large dense-core vesicles and are released into the synaptic cleft in response to depolarization of neurons. The structure of dynorphins is characterized by a high proportion of basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues.

Larger efficiencies are possible for charged rotating black holes. The process is also limited by the maximum rotation rate of the black hole.   The Penrose process extracts rotational energy from a black hole by diving into the ergosphere, dumping an object with negative energy, and returning with more energy. The maximum energy gain is 20.7% of the object's mass for an uncharged black hole. The process spins down the black hole to a lower rotational speed.   The Penrose process is a theoretical mechanism for extracting energy from a rotating black hole. A working body falls into the ergosphere, a region around the black hole where matter is forced to move in the direction of rotation. The body fires a propellant backwards, and the remains fly away with excess energy, offsetting the loss of propellant and energy used.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from an uncharged black hole via the Penrose process?\", ' A deductive argument is considered valid if it is impossible for its premises to be true while its conclusion is false. An argument is considered sound if it is valid and its premises are true. While a valid argument can have false premises, a sound argument must have true premises to be considered valid.   The redundancy theory of truth, also known as the disquotational theory, posits that asserting that a statement is true is equivalent to asserting the statement itself. This theory is attributed to Frank P. Ramsey, who argued that the use of words like \"truth\" and \"fact\" is merely a roundabout way of asserting a proposition.  Deductive reasoning is a process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logical conclusion. It is a form of top-down logic that involves applying general rules to specific cases, resulting in a conclusion that is necessarily true if all premises are true.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the term for an argument that is both valid and has true premises?', \"  Range Gate Pull-Off (RGPO) is an electronic warfare technique used to break radar lock-on. It involves producing a pulse of radio signal similar to the one that the target radar would produce when it reflects off the aircraft, and then increasingly delaying it in time to pull the radar's range gate off the target.   The effectiveness of pull-off can be reduced by changing the radar's pulse repetition frequency or using frequency agility. Denying the capability to respond to signals after hearing them on the receiver can also reduce the effectiveness of pull-off. Pulse-to-pulse comparison techniques can be used to filter out returns that appear to be slower-moving.   Range Gate Pull-Off can be defeated by tracking the original radar signal and extracting its pulse repetition frequency (PRF). The jammer can then broadcast noise across the time frame of the skin reflection to obscure it. Additionally, accurate tracking of the PRF allows the RGPO to broadcast its deception signal on either side of the skin reflection and walk-off in either direction.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What technique can be used to defeat Range Gate Pull-Off?\", \"  Existential phenomenology is a philosophical approach that emphasizes the importance of human existence and experience. It argues that philosophy must begin with an examination of human existence, rather than abstract concepts or universal truths. This approach is characterized by a focus on the individual's lived experience, the temporality of personal existence, and the freedom to modify one's own existence and the world around them.   Existential phenomenology has faced criticisms and challenges from various quarters. Some have argued that the approach is too focused on individual experience and neglects the role of social and historical context. Others have criticized the approach for its emphasis on freedom and responsibility, arguing that this can lead to a neglect of the role of power and oppression. Despite these challenges, existential phenomenology remains an important and influential philosophical approach.   Existential phenomenology has had a significant impact on various disciplines, including literary theory, architectural theory, and philosophy. It has also influenced the work of many philosophers, including Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Hannah Arendt.

Geomorphing adds approximations of the 3D model as intermediate steps between two LODs, while LOD blending displays both LODs simultaneously and blends them together over a small transition period.   Popping is an undesirable visual effect in 3D computer graphics that occurs when the transition of a 3D object to a different LOD is abrupt and noticeable to the viewer. The LOD-ing algorithm reduces the object's complexity as it moves away from the viewer, only to restore it as the viewer approaches.   LOD blending, also known as alpha blending, reduces popping by displaying both LODs of a 3D model simultaneously and blending them together over a small transition period.

They are more common in boys than girls and occur in children between 6 months and 5 years old.  The long-term outcome of children with febrile seizures is generally excellent, with most children outgrowing them. However, some children may experience recurrent febrile seizures, and a family history of febrile seizures may increase the risk of recurrence. Children with complex febrile seizures may have a slightly increased risk of developing epilepsy.  There is no evidence to support the use of fever-reducing medications to prevent febrile seizures. Instead, caregivers should focus on providing supportive care, such as gentle positioning and removal of objects from the child's mouth.

As the read head moves away from the center, the disc's speed decreases to maintain a constant linear velocity, ensuring a constant data rate and bit density.   Optical storage uses a laser to record and retrieve data from an optical medium, such as a compact disc. The data is recorded by making marks in a pattern that can be read back with the aid of light.

If the Wronskian vanishes identically, the functions are linearly dependent. However, the converse is not always true, and extra conditions are required to ensure linear dependence.   The Wronskian is a determinant used in the study of differential equations. It is defined as the determinant of a matrix constructed by placing functions and their derivatives in a specific order. The Wronskian can be used to show linear independence of a set of functions.   The Wronskian has various applications in mathematics, including the study of linear differential equations and the determination of linear independence of functions. It also has properties that make it useful in solving equations and determining linear dependence.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the Wronskian used to determine?', '  The most common salts that cause scaling in RO processes are calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, silica/metal silicates, barium sulfate, and calcium phosphate.   Membrane scaling occurs when sparingly soluble salts in RO concentrate become supersaturated, primarily due to the withdrawal of permeate water from the feedwater, and is dependent on crystallization kinetics, i.e., nucleation and crystal growth.   Membrane scaling is a major operational challenge in reverse osmosis (RO) applications, where sparingly soluble salts precipitate and form a dense layer on the membrane surface, increasing energy costs and reducing permeate water production.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What are the most common salts that cause scaling in RO processes?', ' Linear alpha olefins (LAO) are a range of industrially important olefins with a chemical formula CxH2x, characterized by the linearity of the hydrocarbon chain and the position of the double bond at the primary or alpha position. They are distinguished from other mono-olefins with a similar molecular formula by their linear structure and alpha position of the double bond.  Linear alpha olefins are commonly manufactured by two main routes: oligomerization of ethylene and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis followed by purification. Other routes include dehydration of alcohols and thermal cracking of waxes. Seven commercial processes oligomerize ethylene to produce linear alpha olefins, with five of these processes producing wide distributions of linear alpha olefins.  Linear alpha olefins have a wide range of applications, including as comonomers in the production of polyethylene, as feedstocks for the production of linear aldehydes and alcohols, and as surfactants in aqueous detergent formulations. They are also used in the production of synthetic lubricants, paper sizing, and drilling fluids.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the chemical formula for linear alpha olefins?', '  Inhalation of lewisite is the most common route of exposure and can cause burning pain and irritation in the respiratory tract, nosebleed, laryngitis, and other symptoms.

The spacecraft would have used Jupiter's gravity to increase its velocity and then performed a flyby of Pluto, with a closest approach distance of about 15,000 km.  The Pluto Kuiper Express was initially proposed as Pluto Fast Flyby in 1992. The mission underwent several changes, including a name change to Pluto Express and the addition of a Kuiper belt object flyby. However, NASA ultimately cancelled the mission in 2000 due to budget concerns.  The Pluto Kuiper Express was an interplanetary space probe proposed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) scientists and engineers in 1992. The mission aimed to study Pluto and its moon Charon, as well as one or more other Kuiper belt objects.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the closest approach distance of the Pluto Kuiper Express to Pluto?\", '  Treatment for MGD includes warm compresses, eyelid scrubs, gland expression, and topical medication such as Lifitegrast and Restasis. Intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments and meibomian gland probing may also be used to reduce inflammation and improve gland function.   Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a chronic disease characterized by obstruction of the meibomian glands, leading to evaporative dry eye, blepharitis, chalazion, and meibomian gland atrophy. The dysfunction can be caused by abnormal meibum secretion, quality, or obstruction by thick secretions.   Treatment options for OTC deficiency include sodium benzoate, biotin, and whole-body therapeutic hypothermia (TH), which can help reduce ammonia levels and alleviate symptoms.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is one of the treatment options for Meibomian Gland Dysfunction?', '  The catalytic domain of MMP-1 has a unique structure, consisting of five β-strands, three α-helices, and eight loops. It contains five metal ions, including three Ca2+ and two Zn2+, one of which has a catalytic role.   Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) is an enzyme that breaks down extracellular matrix in various physiological and disease processes. Its structure consists of a pre-domain, pro-domain, catalytic domain, linker region, and hemopexin-like domain. The catalytic domain is responsible for breaking down interstitial collagens, types I, II, and III.

      " Polymorphism in the CYSLTR2 gene has been associated with the inheritance of asthma in separate populations. The M201V variant of CYSLTR2 exhibits decreased responsiveness to LTD4, suggesting that this hypo-responsiveness underlies its asthma transmission-protecting effect.  Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 2 (CYSLTR2) is a receptor that binds to cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) and contributes to mediating allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in humans. It is expressed in various cell types, including blood eosinophils, platelets, and tissue mast cells.  The human CYSLTR2 gene maps to chromosome 13 and consists of four exons. The protein encoded by CYSLTR2 is composed of 347 amino acids and shares only 31% amino acid identity with the CysLTR1 protein. CYSLTR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that activates the Gq alpha subunit and/or Ga subunit of its coupled G protein when bound to its CysLT ligands.  Answer the question using as few words as possible : What is the effect of the M201V variant of CYSLTR2 on responsiveness to LTD4?\n"
